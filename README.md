## The Premise
[OhLife](http://ohlife.com/index.php) was an online diary service that you could write entries to via email. It shut down in 2014, but I had been using it for two years at that point and had written hundreds of entries. When it shut down I downloaded my entire archive of about 60,000 words.

*Another Life* is a novel generated based off of these diary entries. Much of the text remains the way that I wrote it, however all the names of People, Places, Organizations, Numbers (dates, times, quantities) and Media (TV, movies, video games) have been algorithmically replaced. 

The result is a version of my life that takes place in a slightly alternate universe than the original.
