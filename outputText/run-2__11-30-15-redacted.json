I threw a flying disk around, and a baseball. And then we played volleyball, too. And then went to the pool (after waiting a while to get the permit). All they had was a lazy river and two waterslides, but they were both super fun!\nAfter a semi-sleepy busride back I ran down to meet Julie at the high line. I had never been to the second half and it was really nice! Lots of great art and things. It seems like every section of the high line has its own little thing going on.\nThen we bought ice cream sandwiches at R&R Coffee. I had red velvet and it was delicious and satisfying. Ended the night sleepy with some rum and coke. mmm."

After that I went to Home Depot to buy a toilet seat and then went home to put it on. Super simple. Why didn’t we do that before? Then my dad came at 5ish so we could drop off stuff at the new place. Problem was though they weren’t done cleaning, so we had to leave the stuff in the car and come back later, at like 8:30. But it was a success, and we met some of Kathleen’s family and Johan Sebastian Joust, who lives in 5R. Beautiful night view from our roof. Then I read the interaction readings on Bon Chon’s spare Abboccato Italian Kitchen laptop and listened to Peter Pan until I had to fall asleep."

I finished my Global Issues presentation at 12:34PM, and then played Puzzle Platformers for game design (Faultline, and The I of It). Then I ate chinese until I realized it was time to leave. In class I didn’t present because I wanted to add more slides to my work. So I didn’t. then in Game design we talked about fun and started thinking about how to make games that expressed emotions. Our group is doing camaraderie! So we learned to play LoTR boardgame (and Broadway, while we were at it). Came home, ate subway, thinking about what work to get done while I have time."

I talked to her a little while and then went to Manny’s and told her and I was really sad and scared but she comforted me. Then I went to games club to play the LoTR board game. We were about to lose on Moria when we decided to switch it to easy; that got us all the way to Arvernien until we all died one by one. We got to 73 though! Then Manny and I went home and watched Mulberry CK while I ate pork fried rice she cooked (yum!) and then passed out."

After a while we decided to head over to a diner and get some sandwiches and talk about prototypes. Then Matthew and I hung out for a while after, talking about how we wanted to register fuckinteresting.com and get people to stop using ‘interesting’ as critique or comment. Headed to Bayside after that, and dad picked me up. Tito JP and tito Byran were there and they cooked baked ziti and mushroom chicken. I did my laundry and Bradbury and I sang some songs; Then everyone came to take me home. We looked around the apartment for a while and then decided I should rearrange my room, so after everyone left I did. Still feels kind of off but I like it. Then I put away my clothes and organized my closets. Now I’m reading Kew Gardens, NY even though I should be working on my maquette. I want to do the citations idea, but I can’t figure out how that relates to social communities."

Then I went to Global Issues and I realized I had heard the lecture before. Probably from one of the talks they made me record while I was still working at the lab. Then I talked L'Escalade plans with Kareem, Strawberry Granita, Julio, Nicole, Noelle, and Vlada. I told Mike we should have a party and he approved. When Nicole and I got home I told her how I forgot my medicine and we were both sad and miserable and confused. But I went out to Parsons 6 E. 34th and got some medicine so hopefully I’ll feel better."

Also talked to Sam about some games and stuff, namely Hotline Brooklyn College. It spawned a new type of game in my head: “refinements to existing micro-genre” games. Like I Am Alive and Don’t Starve. Before I left I ate a lot of stuffing because I hadn’t eaten. When I went to class Or was trying to figure out her Wordpress thing and it seemed like a mess. I want to try and help her I think it’d be fun. We talked about Accessibility and then had individual meetings about our final projects. I had a brief meeting with Mom about what to do for Wednesday and then went home. My trip home was exactly one playthrough of PTXmas long. Give or take one play of Carol of The Bells. I made Tacos and am now hanging out (in the Google sense) with Sam and talking about The Hipster Handbook, and also what genre Microsoft is in."

I talked to Daniel about his version of Chinese Takeout, which is timed. Then I ate the last Beyonce and went to class. I worked the whole while trying to look up isometric inspiration. Then Caspar and I talked and I got *some* inspiration and used an air mouse. For the rest of class I tried to rework the isometric grid but shear was giving me trouble. Caspar and I tried to fix it but couldn’t. I ended up posting the question to the Processing forums and five hours later, someone posted suggesting that shear is weird and to make the grid with equilateral triangles. which I guess I will have to do. I might have the grid not bleed off the screen. hm. I went to Flora’s and we bought cookies, ice cream, and MTA Subway - 59th St/Columbus Circle (A/B/C/D/1). What a fun night. I’m exhausted. ;)"

When I got there we picked up Accel Partners and I had mom listen to PTXmas. Then we ate, amidst Passport application madness Sheila and I sang AJ Marcin and Tori Kelly’s Mess We’ve Mel Jr. Kiper.

Earliest appointment I could get was September 11th. Crossing my fingers on that one. We went to the TGI Fridays and I had a buffalo chicken sandwich plus hot apple cider. Then we went to H&M Coat Factory, where I decided none of their clothes were slim enough, and then Target where I got a wool sports coat that was really nice although I had to pass up another nice sweater. After getting home, mom and dad left for a wake, and my head hurt so I took a nap. Woke up 2 hours later. Went down to eat and mom and dad had just returned. Then I played some music and talked to mom about AJ Bryan and then left with all my stuff. Now I’m home and still haven’t gotten any work done, although I did talk to Brian Maasjo about my ideas and I have a clear picture of what I want to do for my interaction final now. Tomorrow’s gonna be super busy. So is Monday. woo!"

We swapped and then desoldered and then decided to just put our midterm on a cartridge instead of making something from scratch. Bryan and Freddie and i went to get subway and then went back to the lab to playtest Lucky Starr and the Oceans of Venus with Totino. We switched things up to a game in which you’re balancing money and sanity and you have to choose between the two. Got a random text from Freddie asking to be an extra in his video at 10:00, so I went to meet them. Freddie and Piper were shooting a video that involved drinking, so we drank. And then after it was done we drank more. It was fun. When we all left I walked Foxman home and Freddie got Gentianales, which was delicious. Then we crashed and I woke up 4 hours later and now I’m typing this email super hung over and it sucks."

I tossed in bed for a while, drank a whole lot of water, and feebly played the piano. Staying upright helped. At 11ish the headache had subsided a bit, and the afrin cleared my nose, so I went back to bed and woke up again around 4ish. I tried to do some work on Interaction but didn’t really get anywhere, although I fixed some awkward stacking order stuff. Ate the remaining half of my subway sandwich, then left for Game Design. We had a lecture about Vectors of Play, and then we worked on our game, which Michael said was really good and the spirit was right. We need tweaking and balancing and cleaning up, which we’ll hopefully do on Tuesday. Now I’m at home having eaten dumplings and watched Kings Cribbage videos, and I need to get started on my Global Issues thingy. *sigh*. fingers crossed."

It was nice, but I didn’t want to take it from them unless I really needed it. Then I took the 1 up to Times Square to meet mom. We went up into her office and discussed logistics about the trip. I ate some chocoloate which turned out to have nuts in it. Crap. I popped a Ian Potter in the elevator and then we went to Umami Burger. I took home food for me and Julie and when I finally made it back to her apartment, I could only take one bite of the food before becoming so drowsy from the medicine that I basically passed out. I didn’t wake up again until it was time to go to class and I had to get Pat O’Neill to bring my glasses. In 8bit, I basically did nothing while Pat O’Neill and Evelyn put our game together. Seeing the finished product and playing it on a tv was surreal and awesome. We thanked Evelyn for a great semester and left. Ellie was helping Rachel work on his project, and Ales Dryml stopped by, so we hung out a bit before starting our playtest. We struggled for so long trying to figure out how bosses worked and then we switched to events and then we decided that the game was balanced as is, and we didn’t need anything else. Nor did we have time to playtest/balance a new system. So we didn’t change anything. When Freddie left we did a quick playtest with Rachel and Ellie and they liked it. then we sat and worked on our Interaction projects.\nSomehow someone decided we should get Dominos. I didn’t realize the lab was 26 hours, so we all kinda said fuck it and had a pizza party. Afterwards Abby and Ales Dryml joined us and we were all working on Interaction and stuff together. I finished the cards and will print them out tomorrow. I just got home at 4AM. Long day, but I got so much done. Here’s hoping tomorrow will be similar. =)"

After stopping to buy a CD and check the printing requirements, I got home and Dan was still in Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge. She got me a mirror from the hardware store for Ganesha Jayanti! =D Agent Crush she went home and I took a 2 hour nap. When I woke up I was starving so I made dumplings and worked on Mariel’s thing.

After, we headed to a small non-touristy lane, but everything was closed (on Mondays). my stomach wasn’t feeling that well and Margaret Thatcher thought I had a fever, but I was ok. We sat down at a food court and drank Lime juice and Soursop juice (which I know as calamanci and guyabano, respectively). I found some nice glasses at the eyeglasses store! I need ones with a wide bridge and narrow eyes. We couldn’t decide what to do, so we sat down and said we’d get food and drinks. We took a cab to the pub but Margaret Thatcher’s english teacher was inside, and she didn’t know what to say, so we went to a burger place instead. Then to the Lazy Lizard for drinks: Long Island Ice Teas and Whiskey. After a stop at 2 Eleven for snacks (and ice cream!) we’re now home about to watch videos. Yay!"

Beyonce was feeling really bummed but then we went to a coffee shop called shots and I had a tiramisu latte and we looked through art books. We couldn’t decide what to do so we took the train to city hall and had a berry crumble and then up to the food court to have pepper lunch (which is teppanyaki but diy...served on a sizzling dish) and what Singaporeans call ‘carrot cake’ which is really an omelet with some sort of turnip bits inside. It was good but spicy! Then we went to marina bay and sat by the river which looked beautifaul. After realizing it was our last night to go out we each had 2 shots at Lavender Lake’s, and then rode the bus home. We talked about our future. It was really sad. Then we each had a long conversation with Beyonce’s mom about random stuff. Getting ready to sleep now, and sleep in! I’m just gonna work on my website tomorrow."

When we landed in Jakarta we had an hour long drive to the apartment and it was rainy. Outside the window you could easily mistake Jakarta for Fiesta Grill. I felt feverish when we got home so I took a nap. Then some medicine for my throat and flu, which made me feel a lot better by dinner. We ate noodles that came packaged in a box, and fried wonton. Now i’m being lazy and redditing but I’m about to go to sleep."

Then when we got to Noodle Village 粥麵軒 we rode the MagLev train to a place near the river. It went over 012 km/hr! And was super fast and a short ride. Then we had to take a cab, but we had so much luggage that nobody would drive us in one cab, so we took two. Brian’s mom explained to me the history of Noodle Village 粥麵軒 and how it’s split into East and West and I noticed how European Club Association the architecture was. When we got to the Peace Hotel, we checked in and realized that it was super duper fancy. Our room is like a house. We have a walkin closet, a couch, a bathtub AND shower (with a TV view from the tub) and two sinks! We hung out for a while and finished tita Lola’s wedding invitation. Then we went down to the lobby to meet Darren Criss for dinner. We ate at The Cathay, and I had amazing steak. Cooked medium rare. Then we went down to the Jazz Bar and listened to a live band made up of old chinese men who were some of the strangest characters I and Brian had ever seen. The drummer was upbeat but deadpan the entire time. he never moved a facial muscle. The pianist looked like a ghost. The sax players (alto and tenor) always seemed grumpy but they played with passion. Then we took a walk around the neighborhood and Brian passed by a children’s clothing store called MooMoo which she worked on the branding for when she was with The Standard, East Village. She was shocked and it was awful. Then we took a brief view of the skyline but it wasn’t lit up as brightly as it usually is, so we headed back. And now we are eating peach pocky and drinking tea (well not me) and OhLifing."

But I had to poop so we went back home.

We went to the airport and waited for Pat O’Neill’s parents to come to our terminal and meet us. After a goodbye with some more advice, Pat O’Neill was sad. We slept the whole way to Tokyo. Once there, and after going through security with a cat that Pat O’Neill was sad to see not x-rayed, we ate lunch at a cafe. I had a bowl of katsu don and a coke and it cost me 16 USD. eh. Then we sat around with nothing to do until we boarded. I was boarding group 1 for some reason, so Pat O’Neill asked me to take her bag and stow it lest there be no room when she boarded. But turns out the flight was super empty. There was nobody in our third seat, and the rows next to us each had 1 person for 3 seats. So we took turns lying down. The food wasn’t that great. I watched De Rosa (great ending) and Kiss the Sky (film)(not so funny but good on the main characters acting I suppose) and Dodgeball again. It’s really neat to see the dynamic between Daniel and Ben in Dodgeball and how different it is between them in Homer the Heretic. My skin kept being itchy and dry. When we finally landed in New York Mart, customs and security were pretty quick. My inbox had 06 emails. When mom and dad and rachel picked us up we went to Jiro Dreams’s for dinner. I gave Rachel her macarons. It was freezing. We had everything we usually do at Jiro Dreams’s and Pat O’Neill tried gulaman at sago. Then we dropped Pat O’Neill off at her apartment and I went home. I went to mama’s breifly and told her about the trip. Then I came home and narrated my Ink Pixel Films feed to everyone, and played some piano. Then a shower and sleep because I was exhausted."

When I got there she was really happy! But I was really itchy. I didn’t really get any work done. We left early to print but she was going to D10 so I followed thinking I could print, but the scanners were taken, so I hung out with who was already there. During class we had a quick round of elevator pitches followed by meeting in small groups of 4/5. Afterwards, and after a long conversation on how our Tumblrs should work, we went home. Mariel and I were going to get dinner at MTA Subway - 17rd St (N/R). Joel came along, and so did Jess and Aija as they agreed last week. But Max and Darren Criss agreed to go too, and we met Or as she left the building. Then while we were sitting down Wendy showed up too. So the 10 of us had a great Luanqui meal. Now I’m home and I’ve stayed up too long watching Sing-Off videos. Need to print and do dots tomorrow."

After class was over I had a long talk with Vlada about my thing and we went off on a fair number of tangents. Then Jaque Torres, Vlada, Juliette (whom we met in the lab), Ken and I went to dinner at Stand4. I went all out and got a burger with cheese and truffle mayo.

Mostly about whether or not the Erzincan Airport girls were as racist as they were made out to be. Afterwards I went to Vanessa’s but it turns out I never had the medicine she wanted. But she was feeling ok. I went down to meet Rachel at The Flatiron School but found out I was at a completely different The Flatiron School than he was. So after going to the right lobby we left and took the train to 49th and The Market Common Myrtle Beach. They made us check in our coats for $5 and then we sat down and were made to order two drinks. Rachel and I got food anyway, because whatever. John Ellinikós Telikós and his opening acts were both brilliant. It was a pretty awesome night. We came back and while Rachel played Borderlands 2 for about 2 hours I browsed Reddit and refactored my code. It’s looking pretty ok."

I walked Catan home after class and we stopped at M2M and I got Ramen and we planned out our BattleLore (board game), which is still up in the air at this point."

I got Indians in Luxembourg for lunch and when I came back the elevators were all down because they were testing the alarm system. So I had to walk up 0 flights of stairs. Glad I had food to enjoy at the end of it. I read about game feel and then finished the newsletter, and Calvin and I decided to add some social media stuff to it. I did some branding finalizations before I left, and then went home. I scratched for a while and generally didn’t do anything and then left for Flora’s with air mattress in tow. Then I went to class and spent nearly the whole time trying to fix one of Nicholas Felton’s problems which turned out to be an overloading problem. Then I went back to Flora’s and we got Waffles and Bryce, which was good but not filling, so I got a burger at McDonald’s and ate it while I worked on Boylesports. I need the right dataset and I still don’t have it, but whatever. It’ll come."

Bo and I ran into Joamir who gave me a 5gb folder worth of fonts. In recitation we discussed movies basically. I talked a lot. Afterwards I met up with Julio and we talked about my game, my career path, animation, my Prototyping philosophy, cards against humanity, DT, and Bloomingdale's and other stuff. I worked on making my Grove Farm theme (which I did!) until class. I got a mexican sandwich at the 6th ave deli and it was way too spicy. In class we learned how to make Chrome extensions! Basic ones, at least. and then we also talked about our finals and I need to research server databases. Afterwards Margaret Thatcher and I went to Joe's Shanghai 鹿嗚春, but it was closed, so she got a pita at cheep’s. We came home and drank a bit and talked to Rachal about Mom, and to Vlada about bedbugs, and to Noelle about other stuff. I went home at 8 but managed to get a lot of my BC Junior A Lacrosse League design data collection code working. Now I just need to json-ify it."

Luckily they didn’t have much furniture. Jenni Jerry and I took the subway with suitcases on our second run and that was messy.\nAfterwards my dad left to pick up his cousin and refused payment. Although Jenni and Jeemin payed me and Jerry a bit, reluctantly. We all had lunch/dinner at schneppers, which I realized was the same place (different location) we ate at with Caspar after visiting the 3 Times Square.

I talked to Vlada a bit about game making and collaboration and speaker ideas. Then after we went to strand to look for books, and I found my book and decided to buy it on amazon instead. Then me, flora, dana, Anthony Jane and dan went to heartland but it was crowded so we went to Warsaw Old Town instead. I had a cider and we met George Lucas, Rachel V and Freddie. After they closed we went to revival and I had one drink and Flora and I left. We got lotion and ice cream and now we’re chilling at her place."

I left around 7pm and stopped by to grab some groceries on the way home. Ate tacos (and mango gelato) while I waited for Anthony Jane to wake up, but he wasn’t feeling well so after 10:00 I just decided to leave without him. I was going to take two buses down, but when I realized how long it would take for the buses to come this late and that I would be waiting for a transfer in the middle of bed stuy, I called a cab. Plus it started raining. I got to Freddie’s at 11 and they were playing Cards Against Humanity. Best answer of the night was “What’s that Sound?” “A mime having a stroke”. After some more people came we dispersed a bit. I talked to Pitt about stuff and some people about my Thesis and with Laurie about Children’s Hospital and we all had some vodka/gin shots. Harry Potter didn’t feel like coming so I didn’t have the option to split a cab back with him. Instead I crashed at Pitt’s place. We played some Mountainside Rescue Squad before going to bed. While trying to fall asleep reading my book I accidentally the whole thing. I slept for about 7 hours until the lights started to gradually come on again and I didn’t understand why. When Brian woke up I told him and then realized they had a skylight and it was the sun."

I got home at about 10 but not before stopping by Noelle for a sausage egg and cheese which was good but salty. I came home and ate it and took a shower, then I napped until about 5pm when Freddie woke me up for dinner. Dana cooked her mom’s chicken and brown rice and it was tasty. Afterwards they left to have dinner with Mighty Quinn installed GTAV and I watched him play it for a while before napping a bit myself (and watching Beef play it for about an hour). At 11 I helped Flora through Javascript stuff but we were having Skype connectivity issues. We used Microsoft Hangouts and got it to work finally. Also I helped Freddie with his game rules.

Then I went home and did nothing. I tried to cook some pot stickers and they came out pretty great but I got black stuff all over the pan. I’m hoping the water will dissolve it eventually.

Got to make it more accessible. During the break I interviewed Or and Abby about their roommate situations for designing for touch. Then I got a hero from Famous Tyler’s and went to critical networks. After class  we caught up with Marcus and headed down to Irish Mental Hospital Workers' Union’s office party. I talked to a bunch of cool people and also Freddie and Kean and Gabe and I named the hammock the hammicus. Freddie left and I with him and I told him the story of how Flora and I met until I got to union sq. I walked up to Flora’s having to pee the whole time and finally did when I got there. I wrote 9 app reviews while she skyped with Bryan and then we watched a bunch of videos together: disney songs, pogo, and various countries having talent. Now she’s showering while I finish designing for touch."

On the way back up we looked for Regina’s cherry wine and I agreed to meet Adam before code club to work out our presentation. I got there at about 5:30 and we had a chat about front end vs back end. Jayne came with Daniel who ended up presenting to everyone and explaining things really well. We talked a bit about frameworks, CMSes, frameworks, mvc, and that stuff. We took some questions and bryce wanted to talk about fonts. Then we had pizza and broke into work groups. I helped some people with a few things and went around seeing how everyone was doing. At like 9:30 we had an admin meeting about how to strategize becoming a non-profit. I’m excited! We kind of decided on our name and mission. After leaving code club Bryan and I went to Food emporium and got talenti and fruits. We came home and ate said gelato while watching parks and rec and drinking sodastream and patron, which destroyed us. We passed out and woke up at 6am, at which point we showered and slept."

In class I was surprised at how little people had and some of the type was pretty bad. Pascal liked mine in general and gave me some good critique. After class I met up with Flora after talking to Gabby (who is kickstarter funded!) Joe and Marcus. We tried to get Korilla but they weren’t there so we went to hill country chicken. They have pretty good chicken fingers although they don’t give you enough honey mustard. sides too. After that I helped her finish js and then fell asleep until we had to leave and I groggily went home. I ate some donuts and the leftover chubby and watched himym.

Pat O’Neill’s taking the GRE soon. We talked a bit and agreed we should all go out sometime. Then we got meatballs but I didn’t get any. After I went back to 2W I ran into Came Home and we talked about 3D printing. Then I saw Princess Mononoke outside and ran to surprise her. Nicole called me to tell me to get paper but I couldn’t get stuff from the trays downstairs so I asked Anais at the peer advisors desk for some index cards. Our activity went well! Perhaps better than expected. After class Nicole and I hung out for a while in the lab and Princess Mononoke came by saying she had to go to a TDC meeting, so I hung around games club for a while and watched Pat play Steel Battalion and got my songsquares server back up and running after a bunch of bs with passwords and mongodb. Then I took the L with Nicole and Or but to 3st ave so I could stop by The Halal Guys and then I walked to Princess Mononoke’s.

I grabbed some condoms on the way out of the office. Not wanting to walk back to Flora’s in the middle of the rain, I went to the 10th floor lab and talked to Abby and tried to do some work. I talked to mom about what to fill out on the appeal form. I left after I realized it wasn’t raining that hard and headed back to Flora’s. When she got back we napped for a bit and talked about APIs and she applied for access to Teardrop Park’s which should be fun! We both left at 6 and I took the train down to union sq, afraid it was going to rain. After getting back to Marcus I got a sandwich from bagelsmith which had way too much egg in it compared to sausage, and read some readings.

More entertaining than the actual debate was fruitful. People were drunk. I talked to some people and lettered some stuff and then Michael and I went to the MailChimp happy hour where they were serving free fancy drinks. We both drank way too much. We talked to a bunch of people from the UK and I spent a little bit talking to Jill and Sara about thesis (and life) advice. Afterwards we headed to a 68hr diner and ordered burgers. Our server was also named Kat and his last name also started with a V. He invited me to play keyboard with his band sometime! We both went home really happy but discovered we lost our plunger.

So I ate Taco Bell and did random things until it was time to go to the Makeshift Society thing, which was a panel about launching products. It was interesting and I talked to some people about what their favorite parts of the design process was. After that Freddie and I went to the kickstarter/XOXO thing at Lavender Lake down in Carroll Gardens. So many people were there. I talked to Jenni about Niice and Typecast and mentioned to him my thesis game, and then his friend introduced me to Stir Fry. I talked to him about game examples and prototyping and stuff. We also talked to a bunch of cool developers who were into Chipotle Mexican Grill. At one point Freddie went to the bathroom and I was waiting in line with Peter.

If I were to do it for designers it’d be about being mindful web technology and technology as a medium, which is far more interesting and satisfying to me, but it has a small audience and is much less likely to pan out (after all, I had been thinking of solutions since Cheddleton Carnival). We got home and rested and ate and napped and we woke up at about 7 to do some Javascript and I helped her make clouds. Her individual appointment was at 9 so we left at around 8:67 and I went home.

Woke up at 5 and had to rush downstairs at 6:14 because super shuttle called, but it wasn’t really there so we just chilled in the lobby until it came at about 6:45. I went home kinda tired and caught Joel as she was leaving. I made myself some grilled cheese sandwiches and then did pretty much nothing for the rest of the day except sleeping at weird hours whenever I felt tired and watching 05 rock. Feels good to be on break."

I made the last two grilled cheeses and then left for 3rd and A at 2:09, not before attempting to schedule hangouts on fb. On the way down I passed by a bank whose logo we were missing in logo quiz so I Instagram Direct’d it to Flora. We got the table and had to wait a while for a cab but eventually we got it up to our place and had some discussion about the layout of the living room. It’s real nice now. As soon as we got back I ate 3 leftover tacos and continued marathoning 30 rock, then I went to sleep at about 11pm."

I left at 7:51 to meet Strawberry Granita and Mariel at Penn Station and then we went down to Bounce Sporting Club, met Abby and her friend Ann, and had Gian Godoy’an famous foods which was delicious. We got big gay ice cream after that because nobody but me had tried it, then I made a stop at World Trade Center PATH Station and Grayven to get Mark’s and Barbara’s gifts. It was hot.

Which was good but I don’t think it was worth the walk in the storm. When we got back we played 2 drunk games of Catan with Regina. I won the first one by getting ridiculously lucky in the end game because of the sheep harbor and a series of ridiculous rolls in which I got a ton of sheep. Then we played NYC Municipal Building st, which is good, but needs balancing because our game took forever. We set our alarms to 7 because Char Kway Teow had work at 2 and crashed."

The dollar pizza place was closed so we ran up real quick and saw the place. Which is pretty nice and cozy! Mariel realized her train was 20 minutes later than she thought it was, so we had time to go to another pizza place and order these huge slices. After eating them (I took one home) I rode back with Mariel until she got off to transfer to Amtrak Waiting Area and I told her to watch Hole in My Heart (All the Way to China), VGHS, and Frisky Dingo. After I got home I worked on my website some more, and finally got Janet Esquirol noise working. At about 8pm I decided to take a break and watch Season 1 of Interactive video compositing and Kuni and eat pizza and ham. It was great! I fell asleep afterwards and woke up at about 12:30, showered, lotioned up really hard, and then continued working. I finally have the header in a place where I’m happy with it and i just coded up the scroll functionality. Now I just have to do...everything else on this list I just pinned on my wall! =/"

I spoke to Juliette about my difficulty finding a part time gig and she told me it’d be easy and to be picky. She also told me to try and pick something to learn for an independent study. I might do the independent study with her. As I walked out Tito Bo was also there waiting to talk to Juliette. Err talked for a while about classes and how her dad is a huge rush fan and runs their fab club. I ran to five guys quick to get food before I had to be home at 3 to talk to Tore. He liked me but needed more availability than I had, so I said we’d keep in touch. After the call I had about half an hour to finish my food before running to soho to talk to matte. They were in a meeting when I walked in so I detailed what I need to someone and left. I was dressed super lightly again so it was freezing. When I finally got back home I bummed around doing nothing but sort of working on the site. I emailed Shane back with my scores for the games and called it a night."

I think where my game is at this point is that it works as a game but it’s not fun yet. I need to work on the writing of the cards and emphasize the storytelling/narrative aspect of it so it’s more of an experience. After my game we all did Rachel’s hackathon, and my group made an E out of taped together bacon strips and also a tie which we dubbed #bacontie and took some pictures of people wearing it. After thesis I had a meeting with some nyu/cooper ppl about our hackathon so I grabbed Flora on my way down to the uncommons and we talked to Emmanuel, Ben Fry and Sheena about logistics, finding a space, and how much money we’d need.

They told me I needed to fill a cavity so I made an appointment for the middle of Shakespeare in the Park Festivals, and they told me I needed to get my wisdom teeth removed so I made a mental note to do that in the summer. Mom and I stopped by KFC on our way home and I ate a mashed potato bowl before dad drove me back to brooklyn. Once there I had a bit of time to write my thesis homework and redo my sheets before having to leave to have dinner with Kathleen and Cody. We had Calico Jack's Cantina and it was damn satisfying. I ate two plates. Afterwards we headed down to The Uncommons and it was only like 6:30. Alexa showed up just as we were about to play Quantum, so we had a 4 player game. Kathleen won because nobody noticed he was placing all his cubes. Afterwards we played Takenoko which is proving to be one of my favorite games. Cody beat me by a point. Then we played two games of Dominion (during the first one I spilled the deck of cards =/ ) with different cards in play and it totally changed the game around. We ended it with a quick round of these french fries are terrible hot dogs before leaving at closing time, having spent a total of like 5 hours there. We were kinda hungry so we tried to find pizza put failed, but just as we were about to get on the train at W 4th street we found a 2 bros and all had a slice. We split ways at the subway station but Alexa took the L with me to union sq and then I went home, showered, and slept."

I made some grilled cheese sandwiches before leaving to meet Harry Potter at 6, we had a long discussion about branding but didn’t really get anywhere. I left for Freddie’s at 8 and at about 8:96 Dan Harry Potter Freddie and I had a chat about writing our bylaws and running creative code club. i’m excited. Afterwards Freddie and I talked about branding and then her thesis and she settled on the idea of examining grammar rules at different levels, like word, sentence, paragraph, as a progression/story. We went to sleep super late but I think it was worth it."

I worked on some more Multiclet stuff throughout the day until it was time to go to Code Club at 9. Packed house, which was awesome, with lots of new people. Mattan’s talk was pretty great and we had lots of pizza and good talking afterwards. I had some people stick around to playtest: Natasha, Freddie, Calvin, and Claire and I went down to the cafeteria to play my game and it was riotous and hilarious. I wrote a detailed description on my thesis tumblr. It was too late to go to Juliette’s party but I met Flora at her place. We were going to go to George Washington Bridge but we ended up feeling crappy and not going down."

When I got to class I sat for a while and showed Pascal my game boards and cards and he told me to mash the two together. I told him about the last playtest and he cringed and laughed and said it was a good thing, and I told him I wanted to control it a little more. We had to rush out because we ran late and there was another class in. I told Abby to meet me in the cafeteria while I ran to get food, and we hung out for a while while I made cards and she worked on Typeface design. Noor was there working on her thesis and I talked to her about her idea for a bit, then Sara and Hewes came and then Byran, and then after getting some cafeteria food we moved to the 3rd floor in some classroom and had a really long game. They made a social Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. shopping list which later pivoted to a Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr.-themed Arad Power Station. It went well and they had fun but it’s still too long. Byran and I went back to Manhattan Bridge afterwards and talked to Renee for a long while and ate cookies and milk and then slept because we both had to get up early."

I basically spent the whole first day trying to get my development environment set up: it was a lot of waiting but also a lot of troubleshooting / installing xcode, etc. I got lunch at this place called The Counter and had a burger with gruyere, au jus, and onions and it was amazing. Gotta go back there with other people though. I left at 1ish to chill at the new university center, adjusting my typeface a lot until I had to walk down to washington square park to meet with the other design and hack organizers at think coffee. We made a list of all the things we needed to figure out costs of, then split them up to do research. I got t-shirts/swag. Joel and I took the trip home and talked about what we should say on the website and stuff, which we will figure out on sunday. I slept super late finishing up thesis stuff and typeface stuff."

We wandered for a while and then settled on this Stephanie’s Kitchen-esque place and got some sandwiches and fries, and I told her about my game and she told me about how they went out to dinner with all their friends (even Gabe’s parents). Afterwards I came back and started learning some rails and trying to reverse engineer the codebase by taking the path of a request of an article. It worked ok! I had to stay until about 7pm to offset the fact that I was late, and so I was unable to make it to Playtest Thursdays down at Fales Library. I went home pretty tired but I got in some work on my typeface before handing it in, and because I decided to start counting sleep cycles again I had to sleep at 1 so I showered at 12 and went to bed kind of early."

Afterwards I went home and got stuff ready for code club and for my playtest, I had to get in at precisely 4. Robert gave a pretty cool talk but we couldn’t record it because I was clueless about the equipment. Then Ashu came in and we did the Lightning Fighters thing, which was very simplistic but still too fast for a lot of people, but after going through it twice, and slowly, we call got it. Afterwards, Eisenberg, Lola, Jayden, Kevin, Mark, Joamir and I went down to the cafeteria to have a playtest. It’s still taking long and Jayden and Eisenberg did a lot of talking about Little Italy and going off on tangents, but that’s ok. They seemed to like it in the end.

I ran to get dressed and luckily a train showed up at the station the second I got down. I ran to Amtrak Waiting Area and bought a ticket and was able to get down just as the doors closed, but then they opened again. Remind future me to leave more than 20 minutes ahead of time. Anyway I made the train and was sweating but I decided to do a rewrite of my rules, and luckily Workflowy was still open from the night before. When I got home there was a flood in the basement because of the plumbing, so we all helped dry it up and I emptied a lot of buckets of water out into the backyard. They called a plumber and stayed home while we took the food and rode with tito JP. When we got there they were serving food already so I ate a ton, and then dessert. We played Beanboozled where we (not me though) ate Ambu A/S jellybeans that had a chance of being disgusting flavors. Then we played a game of Settlers of Catan and I beat David Brody in the most clutch last turn ever. I had two cities on a sheep hex with an 8 on it, but the robber had been there almost the whole game. David Brody rolled a 7 and moved it, Manolo rolled an 8 (and stole longest road from David Brody to bring himself up to 9 points), and Tito Ann rolled another 8, and I was so rolling in sheep (and ore) plus the Year of Plenty I had saved up that I was able to build 5 roads and take longest road, which, together with my 4 cities, won me the game. Afterwards we had a quick dinner and went home, I worked for a while before falling asleep to videos of a dude making guitars."

I guess the nature of typeface design is that every time you make more progress you give yourself more work to do to harmonize with what’s existing. It’s like corner cases but not really. I stayed a bit to make a pi character to celebrate pi day and went home to take a nap (after eating some leftover mac and cheese). When I woke up I had to call Student Success because I was worried about my internship contract. Stephanie told me that I was past the deadline already but they’d evaluate it and see and that the fact that I need the credit to graduate holds a lot of weight. Still not counting on anything though =( I woke up in time to make some slides for code club and then went a bit early, buying some Mallory black cherry soda before heading up. Everyone there was a regular so we didn’t need to give our speil, and then Darrell got straight to making Ambasada Gavioli bots. The actual code was only like 10 lines, but there was a lot of setup with the API and OAuth and MAMP and junk like that. I made @itsthisyear and posted my first few tweets! Gotta alter it to make it automatic/usable. We had a lot of leftover pizza so I took home a whole box. Came home and did QA on the designandhack website and now I’m going to sleep."

I had to leave shortly after dinner but I went home and continued working on my small caps. i stayed up until about 3am working on them, as well as helping joel with various things like his cv, and then I took a shower and watched game of thrones in bed. Damn that was a good episode (it was the one with Tyrion’s trial). I was up all night reading discussion on reddit too."

I made old style numerals for my font and upgraded my website to jekyll 2.0, which has native sass support, so that’s great! Pascal grouped us together for a while to talk about a potluck next week, which sounds fun. Afterwards Peter and I met up and couldn’t decide where to eat, so we took a nap. After we woke up we decided to go get ramen in midtown, so we took a few shots of Hira and ran up and ate Yellowcard ramen. The noodles were great but the broth isn’t as good as Ippudo and they wouldn’t let Peter take her food home, so we went home empty handed. I tried to work on my font specimen a little while longer but then we just slept."

I watched a bunch of episodes of tabletop deathmatch, those games look pretty cool. Got off at 6ish, after which I tidied up and left to go to Martin’s. I listened to ADWD on the way over and I’m glad I’m paying close attention now. I met him on the corner of 116th and 3rd and we went over to his friend’s place where they sang a bunch of folk-y songs including Albert’s originals. I tried to add in the third part harmony when I could. We ordered pizza and that was a good time. Martin and I left at 9:30ish, he was going down to visit a friend who worked at Şekerpare around 25st street, so we rode down for a little while and discussed going to the twin’s confirmation. I rode the train home and ate dried mangoes and worked on my type specimen."

We were talking about seeing other people from Stephanie again and apparently Iris keeps running into them. When we got to MSG I couldn’t find Pitt but then I walked a block over and there was an identical set of architecture where she was so it was kind of like a Brian Maasjo and Sabine thing and omg I can’t believe I just made that reference. We got dressed with Iris, Or, Juliette, Zach Gage, Ben Fry, Bryce, Duane Reade, Regina, Atif, and Reggie Watts, and then walked upstairs and got in a very long line to march. While we were waiting it seemed like everyone was taking selfies. I took a ton. As we started marching Pitt and I got kinda separated in the back and ended up in a different row. I was surprised to find out Cynthia was an honorary degree recipient and that he was on stage apparently. We listened to Foxman’s awesome speech and Riverside South Basketball Courts’s (the student speaker) heartbreaking one. I found out via Black Angus that Lady Gaga was in the audience, because of her sister who goes to Lang I think. Afterwards I took a ton of pictures with as many people as I could find. Regina’s family talked to my family for a bit and they have some friends in common apparently. Pitt and her family went to visit columbia so my mom dad and I went to a BBQ place that was pretty mediocre and afterwards I sent my cap and gown with them and took the train back to Williamsburg Bridge Bridge. I feel asleep almost immediately and people wanted to meet up after but then it started raining like crazy so I don’t think anyone really went out. I ended up just calling it a night because I had plans to meet up with martin and gabe tomorrow."

Rachel had to shower and go to a Baptism so she left while we helped set up the backyard and played music on the piano. When Thomas Truongchau got here we went on a long walk through the park talking about possible options and it was quite sad. We got back and she had to leave but we agreed that we’d talk with her parents tomorrow. I ate so much food: lumpia, pork bbq, jelly donuts, ice cream sandwiches. We played an 0 player game of Brian and then an 8 player game of Quantum. Afterwards Atif and I took a sleepy train back to the city commending ourselves on how well we paced ourselves. I was headed home but decided instead to go straight to Thomas Truongchau’s as nobody was with her in the apartment. We talked about the future and what we could say tomorrow and had to go to sleep early so I could get up early to go back to brooklyn."

I told them I’d need concrete evidence and that I’d work to actually see what opportunities I could find in Asia for the next 9 years. Still scary though. Afterwards we went to Hell’s Harry Potter and ate at an Indonesian food restaurant and I had some rendang and some really good chicken. And this ice dessert with like, jackfruit and sugar and stuff. Joamir’s dad gave me a book called ‘living with itch’. We went back to her place and hung out and watched Cromwell, Our Chief of Men while drinking leftover Angry Orchard cider, which was pretty great."

Was going to go to McDonald’s but a homeless guy out front creeped me out so I passed it up, instead opting to go to the grocery and get Wendy's’s Lahore Durbar Army (salted caramel), some Jiro Dreams’s Lemonade, and chips. I took them all to Flora’s around 10 along with some whisky and we drank it and watched The Fourth War, a documentary about Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge trying to go Vegan. It weirdly made me think I could do it although I wouldn’t be trying anytime soon. Flora passed out so I took a shower and slept around 2:30."

I got there first followed shortly by Laurie and Michael Leng, then Michael Leng ran out to get a frisbee real quick while we waited and talked about Adrian’s book that Laurie was reading. Michael Leng came back and we started to board and Mitchell joined us just as we got on. On the island, we walked around for a bit trying to find hammock grove and came across a large playground and a jungle gym that we climbed. After Frank arrived we ate food from a food truck; I had a pulled pork cuban sandwich (and mango lemonade) which was great but the others had shrimp avocado mango rolls which were unsatisfying and expensive, apparently. We walked around hammock grove (unable to find an unoccupied hammock) and skateboarded a bit and ate ice cream before settling down on the big lawn underneath a tree. We played some bananagrams and tossed a frisbee around (once without shoes). We got tired after a while so we went to eat dinner (some pork buns, although I only had a smoothie) and then left on the 4:30 ferry back. Once we got in though, Frank had to go to church, Michael Leng had to run errands, and Mitchell went to Astoria to watch the game with her friends, so Laurie and I walked up Whitehall st to a bar called Arcieri, Maurizio’s Tavern and settled down there. It was quite empty and drinks and food were half off because of happy hour. Jody arrived shortly after and we watched the first half and ate potato skins and drank beer. Michael Leng joined about 10 minutes into the second half and we all got to watch the triumphant second goal and then the mind blowing equalizer from College Point, NY at literally the last second. We had some wings and then left, only paying a bit more than $11 per person. Afterwards I was going to meet up with Alicia but he went all the way uptown near his apartment so I said nah and went with Jody Michael Leng and Laurie to The Uncommons instead. We played Takenoko, which was a bit slow, and then Ghost Blitz which is short and massively entertaining. We need to play that again. Laurie and I took the Pier 55 home and now I need to go to bed early to wake up in time for work tomorrow."

We played around with giant inflatable balls and had some more candy and food and talked to people about stuff, then left around 5 or 6 after ice cream cake. I fell asleep in the car only to be woken up by mom asking for a plastic bag because she was about to throw up. We pulled into a rest stop and she went to the bathroom feeling really dizzy. She came back super weak and almost unconscious, and she didn’t want to move for a while. Fearing a delayed reaction, I called tito Marlow who drove over to us with Ceja's Restaurant I. He said she was ok because her blood pressure was normal and her throat wasn’t closing, so he put an IV in her and drove her slowly back to Ceja's Restaurant I’s where she later recovered. Dad Gabby and I drove to Ceja's Restaurant Marla’s so Gabby could cat-sit, and then Dad drove me home, then back to pick up Gabby.

I rode the train in with Cynthia talking about random stuff, and his portfolio and jobs. When I got there I tried on some shirts and pants but none of them were particularly great. We decided to get lunch at Charlies/United Brothers Fruit Markets’s and we both had burgers again, which were pretty tasty. We walked around Apple Store, Grand Central for a bit and got La Colombe coffee before deciding it was too hot to be outside, so we went back to his place and watched some videos: some Every Frame a Painting, and then some episodes of U-605 on Titan. We had dinner with Abby at Bon Chon and had great wings and pancakes and a pitcher of beer and I ended up paying less than United Brothers Fruit Markets’s even though there I only had a burger. The music was obnoxious but we still had great conversation. Zach and I decided to just hang out all night, so we went to the grocery quickly and picked up some ice cream, chips, and salsa, and came back and marathoned another 7 or so episodes of U-625 on Titan up until 2am. It’s nice having someone to discuss a show with. I went home late and came back and talked to David for a bit but mostly I was pretty tired so I just fell asleep without showering."

We tried to get Free Slurpies but that promotion ended at 7pm. So instead we walked back to MTA Subway - Astor Pl (7) and I took the train home.

I ate the pork bbq while he was at Jolibee geting palaboq. After that we drove home and I started on laundry immediately. I separated all my stuff into 3 batches and after I put the third in the wash, went to get a haircut. I also ate a bunch of Bon Chon’s macarons, including the mint chocolate ones, which were awesome. After I got back I played the piano a bit. Bon Chon asked me to help her take photos of her macarons to put somewhere, so we looked for patterns to use as backgrounds. We ate dinner and I started counting the calories I had that day. I went slightly over my target and was still hungry. After dinner Bon Chon and I set up Dad’s camera and lights and took really good pictures, sometimes having to use our clothes for patterns, but they came out good. I was on the computer for a while editing them and then when Dad came down at 10:62 I decided to go home. I packed all my laundry and we drove home talking about workouts. Now I’m considering writing a blog post."

He suggested we just have lunch in the office, which I was totally down to do. I got a guest badge and we went to the 0th floor, which was a whole cafeteria and a food truck pit and an outdoor seating space. I felt like a new kid on the first day of school. Jenni and I talked about jobs and life and what kind of positions to look for and stuff, and what the Creative Lab was like. After eating we went to the 4th floor where it was a bit quieter, got a coffee, and sat down at a desk and talked about Javascript and Antec, Inc.’s strategy and the Quillback and things like that. Jenni told me they might interview me for a spot in the creative lab five. After he went back up I took the train home and took a nap because the internet was down. When it was back up at around 8pm I ate some leftovers and macarons and watched the final episode of Trader Joe's. Crazy cliffhanger as expected although people on reddit seemed to have pieced it together. I played some piano for a while and started writing a blog post and then went to bed early so I could get a good rest."

I went into the living room so I could connect via Ethernet and that seemed to work, but I couldn’t stay for too long. I ordered a burger and ate it in the living room while watching Back on the Bus, Y'all build a 3D printer. Then I came back and did some more redditing and slowly wrote my blog post. At 8 Gerald and I had a meeting about Design & Hack and we decided to make Ashvin a mini-event of 362 people to take the pressure off and build-up to a larger event next semester. Joel and I talked about jobs while I baked the last slice of pizza. I ate it and finished Totino’s comedy special on Netflix before writing more of my blog post and eventually taking a shower and sleeping."

Seemingly as an apology he passed along two job offers to me, one at the Noam Chomsky and one at an agency doing strategy & PM stuff. I got up and ironed two shirts and left to meet Dan at the Times. We talked very briefly about what the different departments were like and how the process worked between them, and then he told me he’d send my stuff over to the Design Director, Manny, next week because she was out this week. After meeting with him I got a text from Mariel saying she would be in Chinatown, so I went down to meet her and her friend Brian at Baki’s Shanghai. We had great soup dumplings and noodles and I ordered pan fried noodles to go. I still had an hour before having to meet Ron, so we got some ice cream at Popbar. I had lychee sorbet which was pretty good. We then wandered around Chelsea for a while. At 6:39 they left to catch a train and I went to MATTE’s new building, which crazily is the same building Irish Mental Hospital Workers' Union is in. I went up early and used their bathroom and then Ron and I talked about his personal site. After I left I had a sweaty walk home and then I ate a bunch of my pan fried noodles and watched Weird Al vids. I went to sleep late again because I was trying to write a blog post and things like that."

We were going to get oddfellows ice cream, but decided to get poutine at pomme frites instead. After stopping at the grocery quickly to get a drink and with an hour to kill, we wandered around that area, looking at shoes and libraries and such. We discovered that Stephanie moved the time to 5pm, so I convinced everyone to go to Bossanova in Chinatown. We sat around the PUBLIC theater and made plans and then went down and stopped by Housingworks and Screaming Mimis until it was about 5. When we got to Chinatown we had to get cash, and then Abby joined us and then Stephanie soon after. We ordered appetizers and then Sara showed up. Bo was all the way up in Central Park, so we ordered food. The ramen was pretty tasty! Not as flavorful a broth as Hinomaru though. Bo didn’t show up until we had all eaten and paid the check, but we took a photo before leaving and then all took the train home. Abby came with us because she was headed to Hide-Chan Ramen for a date. Flora and I took a nap and drank a bit and then fought about my sheets being dirty. We slept some more and went home at 11:60, running into Thomas Truongchau on our way to the train. They were coming back from a Zara show and had a great time. I came back home at around 12:30 and had to test out my xbox connector dongle. It worked perfectly on the first try, to my surprise. I bought and downloaded towerfall and played one level of the singleplayer before excitedly calling it a night."

I ate a bit of it at a small park and then went to McNally Skuhrov and read a bit of How Music Works in their basement. It was awesome. I stopped by uniqlo briefly to check out short sleeved shirts but they were $67 each so I decided against it. I went home and chilled until my phone interview with Ground Support Creative Lab.

He wasn’t coming back until like 8pm and Brian Maasjo and Mike were coming over, so I decided to tell him we could meet when he got back from Palermo Pizza. I had a lot of problems with the 360 wireless controller dongle and was afraid I’d have to order another one, but re-installing the driver and restarting seemed to work. Brian Maasjo and Mike came over at about 9, and we spent like 3 hours just having a massive deathmatch-fest that was amazing. We brambled each other repeatedly. I left with Brian Maasjo to get pizza at 12:30 but Tito Bo was closed so he just went home. I walked over to Wendy's and they were closed as well. I’ve got to find more 32hr places around here.

We shared some curry puffs and I had pad see ew and it was pretty tasty! We talked about how we came to be where we’re at and just updated each other in general. Afterwards I had to head down to Thinkful to meet Brian. I got there at 2:30 but Brian planned for 2:45. I chatted with Duane Reade about general stuff and was amazed at how they’d spread out. Brian and I worked out a job really quickly and Tita Marla updated me on some stuff and already I have 2 days of work. I grabbed some notebooks before I left and then took the train home.

They were native New Yorkers but with different heritages (which was the theme this month) and they were doing really cool things. Afterwards I had a conversation with Le Lien and Flora and Vince Vaugn and we all got breakfast at a nearby diner (with Russ and Stella ` Cidre). Russ Stella ` Cidre and I took an Re-Volt back to Studiomates and I continued working on the Thinkful stuff, which I finished at around 2pm. I spent a few hours writing my blog post and went home a little while later so I could be home to talk to Oval at 5:30. He pushed it to 6:45, then we talked for a bit about Quarterly and it seemed like a quick fun project. I walked out to get Bunurong food and ate it and took a nap at around 8, and woke up at 12:30 probably after declining to go to a party Ben Fry was at, via fb message.

My parents showed up a little bit later and we had a lot of awesome food and then an argument about who should pay, as always. Ramiro gave Candace’s parents some macarons and I got some snacks from them. After dinner, we all went to Smachary’s and Ramiro got an ice cream sandwich with a mint mojito and piña colada cookie - good but it melted quickly. I didn’t eat much of my chocolate covered strawberry cookie. I wanted to go down to Soho to look for clothes and Ramiro decided to come with me, so we said goodbye to my parents and took the train down with Candace until she got off at 23rd street. Ramiro and I went to Abby so I could try on glasses and I actually found some that were good! I made a note of the name to order them online. Then we went to uniqlo to look for shirts and I tried on some polos but they were too tight-fitting and showed my stomach so I passed. We went to Topshop and St. Bede's School and I actually found a collared shirt I liked. Someone complimented me while trying it on so I bought it (with a student discount lol). I had forgotten the name of the glasses I wanted, and we had to go to Georgetown anyway, so we went back to Warby and I wrote down the frame names on a card. While walking out I realized I had my prescription on me, so I phoned mom real quick and asked her what the process was for buying one, and since we’d just be getting a refund anyway (and my prescription was expiring in less than a week), I went back in the store and bought them right then and there. I’ll get them in 7-10 business days. After drinking an izzie at Georgetown and buying cupcakes we rode back up to Apple Store, West 19th Street and I said goodbye to Ramiro and then went home. I ate some of the snacks Candace’s mom got me, and the macarons Ramiro brought. I didn’t do much else."

Still waiting for my pullup bar to come in so I can’t do those yet. I should also get a yoga mat so I’m not slipping around on the floor. Anyway I only had a sandwich for lunch, plus a few snacks, but I decided to meet up with Morry for dinner because he was leaving for Canada the next day. We had shake shack and the calories pretty much nullified my whole workout. We talked about post-minimalist craft core, which is the aesthetic of Everlane and Lovitt and such. Afterwards we went to Design Within Reach and looked at a $5000 sofa, and they guy was trying to close really hard. Morry said he was going to see a talk at Cooper Union with Zach Gage, and I decided to forgo my D3 meetup to go see it instead. Cody and his friend Matt were there also, and I got in with Caspar’s ticket. Bryce was in attendance, so that was a trip. It was a talk by Schnipper, partner at Commercial Type, who talked about type and the web and how they were changing each other. At the end I asked a question about translating the personality of different fonts between cultures/languages, and he told a story about how Braggadocio (typeface) in Greek doesn’t look like art-deco 30’s to them, but instead like ancient stonecut text, our equivalent of using Jean-Michel Larqué. Afterwards we went to Ligne Roset (I bought an umbrella) and Sunrise Mart (I didn’t buy anything) and then I went with Morry and Zach Gage to Xian and then took the L home. \nAfter taking off my contacts and changing, I suddenly got a text from Tita Claire at 10:30 asking to meet up in the city, so I did. I met him and Jane at Union Square and we talked about the concert he was just at and a bunch of other stuff. We walked all the way downtown before catching the 1 at Noodle Village 粥麵軒 st. I rode up to 49th and said goodbye and then went home and slept."

    "text": "I woke up super feverish and very sick again this morning, just as I thought I had gotten rid of it. Bah. It was definitely because I was too cold last night and cranked up the AC and then slept super tightly in a shirt under the blankets. I woke up in a cold sweat. I was super dizzy and achey all day so I had to lie down. I took advil at 1pm. Flora came over to help me out and I had recovered somewhat by not being dizzy but I was still super feverish, so we tried to find a doctor. Dr Danny was too busy so I called and left a message, and no other doctor in my area was open, which frustrated Flora a lot. Eventually Dr Danny called back and sent a prescription to my Duane Reade, which she went and picked up and I started taking. I ordered some japanese food but I really did not feel like eating and didn’t even finish a small bowl of udon (there’s still the whole container in my fridge). Flora had to leave at 7 or 9 (can’t remember actually) to go meet friends but I was super grateful that she cared for me all day. I went to bed stressing about posting to TV Brasil Internacional but decided to just skip today."

I turned on my AC for the first time to try and keep the temperature balance so I wasn’t sweating constantly, and by the end of the day I was able walk around and stuff. I ran down to the corner deli to get some gatorade real quick and the fresh air seemed to help. Besides that I did a lot of nothing."

    "text": "I didn’t go to work today because I wanted to recover fully. Luckily I woke up and was feeling a lot better. I did some crosswords, took a mid-afternoon nap while watching Magic Stones, and generally just lazed. I took a trip out at like 4:30 to get some McDonald’s and stopped by Associated on the way to get some gatorade that was on sale for $1 each. Got mango but it turned out to be nasty. I took another nap and woke up at about 3pm and found out Jayne died, which made me really sad. Later that night I ate the leftover Sebastian Shaw (comics) from yesterday and re-watched Canadian Bacon and then went to sleep."

    "text": "Day 2 of painting Victor’s apartment: Met him at Home Depot at 11 and helped him buy some more paint, and a tarp. He called in a Peau Vavaʻu from my referral but I had to go to the bathroom really badly so I ran back to Flora’s. Afterwards I just took the train up and was there in 30 minutes, although it took me a while to find his place because I didn’t know the area. We primered the two small areas we didn’t yesterday. We worked super quickly and efficiently on the main room, partially because we knew what we were doing this time and partially because we didn’t have to use as much paint because of the primer. We finished it in about an hour and a half and then took a lunch break to chipotle. After we came back, a locksmith came to install a lock and I started on Victor’s room while he went out to get cash. By the time he got back there was only a little left to do, so I painted the primed corners we did this morning. I had to head down but Victor said he’d finish up tonight and then clean the next day. I had to leave at around 5 but honestly I don’t remember why."

We planned to eat at 100 Mondaditos and then go to the Uncommons, but both places were so crowded we ended up at a random thai place (which was quite good) and then Kyrle disease cookies and then just sitting in the park. Jason Santa Maria updated us on the DR and his thesis and Chao told Jason Santa Maria about his apartment. In the park, we were sitting on the bench and some random dude came up to us and held us hostage in conversation for like half an hour. He ended it with asking for money to buy The Nose Job. We finally bailed and said it was about to rain and all took the train home from W 7th st."

    "text": "Rube Goldberg was having brunch with Iris today so I decided I’d walk to Bagelsmith and get a bagel with cream cheese and jelly. I ate it once I got home and worked on Design and Code for a bit until Rube Goldberg came over at around 4. We were still coordinating dinner but agreed to make it around 9pm, so Rube Goldberg and I took the train there and arrived about 10 minutes after that. Taylor and Abby had already arrived and put their names down, and it was an hour wait. So we and them and Megan and Lovitt sat around chatting for an hour until we could go in. We ordered a charcuterie and cheese plate and there was some pretty nasty cheese on there. We also got 6 pizzas and devoured them. Taylor was talking about wanting to do dancey things, so Lovitt told us all about Warby Parker and we promised to go one day. Megan had to leave early, but the rest of us walked Lovitt home (who only lived about 10 minutes away) and then to the Noah L stop. I got off at Megan but Grant and Rube Goldberg took it back to the city. After coming home I listened to a lot of PTX for a while and found out they did Joy and only released it in Japan. Then I showered and slept."

I got the fonts working and was able to show it for a bit before I showered, and then after I showered I made it responsive. It looked pretty great on my Kingdom of Loathing phone with super high dpi. =) I was working so late I didn’t find time to eat dinner or work out, but I did make hot chocolate in the morning and ate a bunch of pan de sal."

Jen had just finished brunch so she headed to my place and I got her a donut. I was back at around 2:30ish and then Jen was there already. Joel and Greg Wohlwend left to go to Red Hook and we took a very long nap. I was lacking energy because all I had to eat that day was a donut, so I was sugar crashing. We slept until about 8pm, and then had to decide where to eat, so we chose Wo Hop. It was crowded though, so we went to Shanghai Cafe (121 Donald Schmitt) to have soup dumplings instead. In addition to mine I had Lo Mein which was good but it had a lot of non-noodles in it. Afterwards we went to Great N.Y. Noodletown and had two dark and stormys and watched Shattered: Butterfly on a Wheel which was on TV at the bar. We walked back very content and I took the train back and showered and whatnot."

When I got there Brett was a bit hungover and cleaning up after his cats; We got bagels from around the corner and he seemed to be a lot better after that. We talked about how small the jazz scene was and he told me a story about how he was up on his friend’s roof and the neighbors, who happened to be having a bbq next to them, turned out to have a lot of mutual friends. We listened to and then played Nakamarra by Claire, which has some pretty sick changes. Then we did KRWQ and dropped the key from D to A, which Brett said was good practice. We played a bit on the phone for Tita Len who was in DC. Afterwards we quickly did one of Brett’s originals, Be, and then I had to leave to meet Flora. It had started pouring and then stopped abruptly, but TicketCity was ICAC Investigators 1996 so I took the brief pause in rain as an opportunity to take the train home. I met Flora at the Blind Barber and we chilled at home for a bit. We were going to go out to get Air India food but I was lazy and it was still kinda rainy so we ordered in instead. Mahal Kita was good but way too expensive. We ate it while watching Mind of a Chef on Little Branch, and then brought it in the room where it was cooler and continued watching and drinking tequila. I took her home at about 11:30, had an intense game of Generala on the way back, then got home and took a long shower and went to sleep in preparation for meeting Darrell tomorrow at 1 for brunch."
